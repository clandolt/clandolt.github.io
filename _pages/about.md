Welcome to the personal website of **Christoph R. Landolt**, Research Assistant in Machine Learning at the **Institute for Computational Engineering**. My work is primarily focused on advancing autonomous and multi-agent systems through the integration of machine learning, reinforcement learning, and signal processing methodologies.

A dedicated researcher with a robust background in computer science, I have a strong interest in game theory, which allows me to approach complex challenges with innovative solutions. My research is centered around practical applications, bridging the gap between theoretical frameworks and their real-world implementations. I am deeply committed to pushing the boundaries of technology through cutting-edge research and development.

## Research Interests

My current research explores various aspects of machine learning, particularly its applications in autonomous systems and multi-agent environments. Key areas of focus include:

- **Autonomous Systems**: Developing systems that can operate independently, making decisions without human intervention using advanced machine learning algorithms.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Investigating the interactions between multiple autonomous agents, with a focus on cooperative and competitive scenarios.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Applying reinforcement learning techniques to optimize the decision-making processes in complex environments.
- **Signal Processing**: Utilizing signal processing methods to improve the performance and reliability of machine learning models in real-time applications.
- **Game Theory**: Leveraging game-theoretic approaches to enhance the strategic decision-making capabilities of autonomous systems.

## Education & Background

I hold a degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. My academic journey has been characterized by a strong emphasis on both the theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning, allowing me to contribute to the field through various research projects and publications.

## Ongoing Projects

Currently, I am involved in several projects that aim to innovate within the realm of autonomous and multi-agent systems. These projects are geared towards practical implementations, with a goal of translating theoretical research into solutions that can be applied in real-world settings.
